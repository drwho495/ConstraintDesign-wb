# Constraint Design FreeCAD Workbench.

### What is the point of this addon?
I've created this addon because I wanted a way to design parts in 3d in FreeCAD with a constraint solver, 
this is how [SolveSpace](https://solvespace.com/index.pl) works. This WB also uses datum selectors 
for each feature, which means that there won't be many [Topological Naming Problems](https://wiki.freecad.org/Topological_naming_problem) without any mitigation.
